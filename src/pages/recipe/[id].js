    comments: "Beans can be replaced with red lentils. \nHere are some ideas for variations (which are endless!). \n1) Replace mung beans with red lentils. \n2) Add chopped plum tomatoes, finely chopped kale stems, finely chopped carrots or other root veggies of choice before cooking. \n3) After cooking, add chopped leafy greens (kale or Swiss chard) and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes until greens are tender. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro, fresh lime or lemon juice."
